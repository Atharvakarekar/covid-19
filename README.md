The dashboard is still raw but it provides a basic functionality of displaying the global and per-country data charts.

Here is what the main function looks like:

## Data source and tech-stack

The dashboard is using [COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as a data source.

Front-end oriented Because I wanted to keep it as straightforward as possible, the dashboard just uses [React.js] (https://reactjs.org/), without the JSX transpiler or the "CreateReactApp" starter. I used [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to create the chart.
